								<b>Employment</b> <br>
								<i>2024 - 2027</i><br>
								Research Fellow in the Sun, Stars and Exoplanets group, University of Birmingham, UK<br>
								Aim: using the four decades of Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) data to investigate stellar variability phenomena across a magnetic cycle on timescales from minutes to months<br>
								<br>
								<b>Education</b> <br>
								<i>2020 - 2024</i><br>
								PhD in Astrophysics at the University of Exeter, UK <br>
								Supervisors: Dr. Raphaelle Haywood, Dr. Tim Naylor<br>
								Title: Breaking the stellar activity barrier to determining robust masses of small exoplanets<br>
								<br>
								<i>2016 - 2020</i><br>
								MPhys in Physics and Astronomy at Durham University, UK <br>
								Master Project Advisor: Prof. Cedric Lacey<br>
								Title: Study of the galaxy merger rate in the EAGLE simulation<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests</b> <br>
								I focus on understanding the stellar activity signal in radial velocity surveys for the detection of exoplanets.
								I am involved in "Sun as an exoplanet-hosting distant star" studies.
								I currently am developing a new calibration pipeline for the BiSON solar data in order to extent its stability beyond 1 day.
								We are doing so in order to study longer term stellar variability in one of the longest solar RV dataset.
								<br>
								At the same time I am leading the development of another pipeline that aims to generate disk-integrated polarimetric Stokes profiles starting
								from resolved solar images.
								<br>
								I am a planet hunter.
								I have developed a python3 pipeline called MAGPy, a Gaussian process regression tool with MCMC paramter search algorithm.
								I used this new pipeline in the detection and characterisations of two systems with the HARPS-N Science Team. I have also
								used in studies on the effectiuveness of the mean longitudian magnetic field, measured from SDO/HMI data, as a stellar activity tracer.<br>
								<br>
								I am a member of the High Accuracy Rocky Planet Search for the Northern Hemisphere, Guaranteed Time
								Observation Consortium (HARPS-N GT) Science Team and Solar Team, and I am a collaborator in the PoET
								solar feed consortium.<br>
								<br>
								I am passionate about scientific dissemination and am therefore very active in public outreach. I especially love working with
								younger students and children, from visiting schools, exchanging letters to direct pastoral mentoring in highschool.<br>
								<br>

								<b>Recalibrating the BiSON solar data: beyond the 1-day stability</b><br>
								I am developing a pipeline to extend the calibration method for the solar data observed by the Birmingham
								Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) with the aim of studying longer term solar variability in the Extreme Precision Radial Velocity regime.
								<br>
							<p>
								<b>Disk-Intregrated Stokes Profiles from resolved SDO data</b><br>
								I am developing a new method to account for magnetic intensification signals that combines simulations and observations. This is the first
								general RV model to include magnetic intensification effects and compute both polarised and unpolarised line profiles.
								Full Stokes profiles are computed for each pixel with a generative model that includes Zeeman and magneto-optical effects.
								<br>

								<b>Past Projects</b>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>Gaussian process regression of temperature-dependent radial velocities</b><br>
								I perform a GP regression analysis on solar RV time series measured from spectral segments formed at different temperatures
								within the photosphere in order to evaluate the relation between the best-fit GP kernel hyperparameters and
								the observed differential activity signal.

									<b>The Mean Longitudinal Magnetic Field and its Uses in Radial-Velocity Surveys: SDO/HMI and HARPS-N data</b><br>
								I investigate the efficacy of the mean longitudinal magnetic field as a detector of stellar rotational period
								of solar-like star and  as a tracerto model stellar activity-induced variations in radial velocity surveys. <br>
