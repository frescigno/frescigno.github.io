								<b>Education</b> <br>
								<i>2020 - Present</i><br>
								PhD in Astrophysics at the University of Exeter, UK <br>
								Supervisors: Dr. Raphaelle Haywood, Dr. Tim Naylor<br>
								Title: Breaking the stellar activity barrier to determining robust masses of small exoplanets<br>
								<br>
								<i>2016 - 2020</i><br>
								MPhys in Physics and Astronomy at Durham University, UK <br>
								Master Project Advisor: Prof. Cedric Lacey<br>
								Title: Study of the galaxy merger rate in the EAGLE simulation<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests</b> <br>
								I focus on understanding the stellar activity signal in radial velocity surveys for the detection of exoplanets.
								I have developed a python3 pipeline called MAGPy, a Gaussian process regression tool with MCMC paramter search algorithm.
								I am using this new pipeline in the detection and characterisations of two systems with the HARPS-N Science Team.<br>
								<br>
								I am also involved in "Sun as an exoplanet-hosting distant star" studies. In particular, I am looking at the solar longitudinal,
								line-of-sight magnetic flux, measured with the SDO/HMI, and to whether it can be a good proxy for detecting the stellar rotational
								period and for modeling stellar activity.<br>
								<br>
								I am a member of the High Accuracy Rocky Planet Search for the Northern Hemisphere, Guaranteed Time
								Observation Consortium (HARPS-N GT) Science Team and Solar Team, as well as a collaborator for the Terra Hunting Experiment
								Consortium in the Science Team, the Solar Team and the Polarimetry Team.<br>
								<br>
								I am passionate about scientific dissemination and am therefore very active in public outreach. I especially love working with
								younger students and children, from visiting schools, exchanging letters to direct pastoral mentoring in highschool.<br>

								<b>MAGPy Pipeline</b><br>
								MAGPy: a pipeline for Gaussian Process regression with MCMC parameter space searching algorithm, developed in the context of stellar
								activity reduction for planet detection. It is developed to be self-contained and flexible enough to fit any Gaussian process need.
								Kernels and models can be modified or added. It has a affine invariant MCMC algorithm, which can optionally be parallelized.
								It includes publication level plotting. It is the process of being packaged for public release, with extended API.<br>

								<b>Longitudinal, line-of-sight magnetic flux as a proxy for stellar activity: SDO/HMI and HARPS-N data</b><br>
								I am investigating the efficacy of the longitudinal, line-of-sight magnetic flux as a proxy to detect the stellar rotational period
								of solar-like star and to model stellar activity-induced variations in radial velocity surveys. Preliminary analysis shows that,
								while it is not directly correlated to the RVs, when used in a Gaussian Process regression framwork it consistently outperforms other
								proxies, especially in the low-activity regime.<br>
